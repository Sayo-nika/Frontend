This folder contains files used for the mock development api for Sayonika.
This is not meant to be used in production at all, it's just there for data to test stuff out.

 - `jsonServer.js` The main file that runs the server and stuff.
 - `db.js` The file that generates and exports fake data for the server to use.
 - `routes.json` Defines routes like `/v1/` that the server uses.
